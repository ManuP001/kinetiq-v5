backend/app/core/config.py

Named constants for the Kinetiq v2 backend (CLAUDE.md §3: "All constants — model names,
thresholds, latency budgets, streak windows — live in backend/app/core/config.py. No magic
numbers inline, anywhere.").

Design principle: this file holds GLOBAL / cross-cutting constants only. It deliberately does
NOT hand-copy per-exercise numeric thresholds (knee_cave_x, torso_lean_max_deg, etc.) — those
live solely in exercises/*.json (CLAUDE.md §6), loaded at runtime via load_exercise_library().
Duplicating them here was exactly the failure mode that caused kinetiq-demo2's CONFIG object to
drift out of sync with exercises/*.json and the Vision_Contract spreadsheet (see CHANGELOG 0.3.0)
— one source of truth per value, always.

No pyproject.toml/requirements.txt exists in this repo yet, so this module is stdlib-only
(no pydantic-settings). Model-name keys read from the environment with a default so they're
env-overridable later without adding a dependency now.
