evals/gate0/detector/flag_hysteresis.py

Flag-level temporal hysteresis + visibility gating (SPRINT.md G2 "precision-first flagging" --
the direct fix for the field hip-sag false positive: a rep with a genuinely straight body flagged
because ONE noisy frame's angle dipped below the threshold).

detector/faults.py evaluates each fault rule per FRAME (unchanged -- Stage 1 kept the rules
"as-is" and this stays true: no new fault semantics, no threshold tuning). Stage 1's adapter.py
called that rule exactly once, at the rep's single deepest-point frame -- fine for "what did the
worst point look like", useless for telling a one-frame jitter apart from a real, sustained
fault. This module re-evaluates the rule across EVERY frame in the rep's [start_ms, end_ms]
window (the RepEvent from rep_counter.py -- untouched; see that module's own docstring, and
ROADMAP.md's Stage 3 entry, which is ALREADY built there: smoothing/hysteresis/tempo/graded-depth
on the rep COUNTER, not the flags) and only commits a flag to the rep once the fault held true
for a large enough FRACTION of the frames where it could be evaluated at all.

Scope: only the 5 per-frame, landmark-based flags have a predicate in faults.py and go through
this module -- knee_cave_left, knee_cave_right, shallow_depth, elbow_flare, hip_sag
(SUSTAINED_FLAG_IDS). shallow_pushup and shallow_lunge are REP-AGGREGATE rules (compared against
the rep's overall smoothed minimum angle from rep_counter.py, not any single frame's landmarks);
they already inherit that module's temporal smoothing and have no per-frame landmark evidence to
gate on, so they are evaluated exactly as before (detector/faults.py's aggregate functions,
called once per rep) and never reach this module.

Three possible outcomes per flag, per rep -- FlagOutcome:
  - PRESENT / ABSENT: the fault held true in >= its required fraction of evaluable frames.
  - INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE: too few frames had visible-enough landmarks to judge at all
    (< FLAG_MIN_EVALUABLE_FRAMES). This is NOT "absent" -- it is surfaced to the caller
    (detector/adapter.py) as its own outcome, never silently folded into "no flag" the way a
    missing landmark silently was before Stage 3.

A frame's evidence for a flag doesn't count at all (neither towards "present" nor "absent") if
that flag's OWN involved landmarks are below FLAG_MIN_VISIBILITY on that frame -- this reuses
each predicate's own per-side "which landmarks does this rule actually read" logic (via the
`min_visibility` parameter every faults.py predicate takes) rather than a second, independently
maintained landmark list that could silently disagree about which side's data a dual-side rule
(elbow_flare, hip_sag) is trusting.

Severity-aware, precision-first (SPRINT.md G2): the required sustained fraction is keyed off the
SAME severity taxonomy as everything else (EXERCISE_LIBRARY.md §4) -- high-severity requires the
LARGEST fraction, trading missed faults for never falsely accusing a good rep on a safety-relevant
flag. All three fraction floors (and FLAG_MIN_VISIBILITY, FLAG_MIN_EVALUABLE_FRAMES) are
PLACEHOLDER values in config.py pending real golden-set tuning (GOLDEN_SET_PROTOCOL.md §8) --
this module is the mechanism, not the calibration.

Safety-veto invariant (VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md Stage 5b): this module only governs WHEN a flag
FIRST commits to a rep. Nothing here, and nothing downstream of it, can un-commit or clear a flag
that already committed -- there is no "clear" operation in this module at all, only "decide once".
