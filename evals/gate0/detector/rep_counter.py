evals/gate0/detector/rep_counter.py

The hybrid rep counter (VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md Stage 4, deterministic-FSM half only -- the
"optional learned boundary model" is Stage 3 of ROADMAP.md, not built here). Generic and
exercise-agnostic: it finds "genuine down-up excursions" in ANY smoothed angle signal, not just
knee/elbow angle, so it has no notion of squat/pushup/lunge at all -- that mapping lives in
exercise_signals.py, one layer up.

Algorithm: median-smooth the signal, then track it as a simple valley-with-minimum-prominence
detector with hysteresis:
  - watch for the running peak ("top reference") while seeking a descent;
  - once the signal has dropped more than REP_COUNTER_HYSTERESIS_DEG below that peak, we're
    descending -- keep tracking the running minimum;
  - once the signal has risen more than the hysteresis margin above that minimum, we're
    ascending -- the tracked minimum is the candidate rep's bottom;
  - the rep candidate CLOSES when the signal returns to >= REP_COUNTER_TOP_ANGLE_DEG.

A closed candidate only COUNTS if both:
  - its excursion (top reference - minimum) is >= REP_MIN_EXCURSION_DEG (below that: fidget/pose
    noise, not a rep attempt -- discarded entirely, not even as "very shallow"); and
  - its duration is within [MIN_REP_DURATION_MS, MAX_REP_DURATION_MS] (the rep-validity gate's
    tempo-plausibility check, VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md Stage 3) -- too fast is jitter, too slow
    isn't one continuous rep.

Depth is deliberately graded, not thresholded here: every counted rep reports its raw minimum
angle; how "good" that depth was (relative to the exercise's own correct-bottom band) is computed
by the caller (detector/adapter.py, via exercise_signals.get_bottom_angle_max) -- this module
doesn't know what a "correct" depth is for any given exercise, only where the genuine excursions
are (EVAL_STRATEGY.md case #5: partial reps count, graded, not dropped).

A None sample (no locked/plausible subject that frame -- a signal gap) is simply skipped: it
doesn't advance the running peak/minimum, but it doesn't reset an excursion in progress either. A
gap long enough to make the eventual duration implausible is caught by the tempo check above, not
by special-cased gap logic.

count_reps() only returns CLOSED rep events -- exactly what the eval harness needs (a frozen clip
either has a rep or it doesn't). A live prototype also needs to know what's happening RIGHT NOW,
mid-rep, which the FSM already tracks internally but count_reps() discarded. count_reps_with_state()
exposes that trailing state without forking the FSM: both functions share the same loop
(_run_fsm), so there is exactly one place this algorithm is implemented -- count_reps() is now a
thin wrapper, unchanged in signature and behavior (every existing caller/test is unaffected).
