evals/gate0/prototype_api/cues.py

INTERIM cue layer for the live detector API. This is explicitly NOT the Stage-6 calibrated LLM
judge (VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md Stage 6, EVAL_HARNESS_STAGE0_SPEC.md §10/§12) -- it is a plain
lookup into the exercise library's own coaching_cues text, never cue copy invented here.

Positive-first (CLAUDE.md §2's "positive-before-correction" invariant): a clean rep (no committed
flags) maps to the exercise's `coaching_cues.good_rep`; a flagged rep maps to the FIRST committed
flag's `coaching_cues.flag_cues[...]` text, in the exact order run_detector's own `flags` list
already produced -- never re-ordered or re-decided here (that ordering is
EXERCISE_SUSTAINED_FLAG_IDS-then-rep-aggregate, detector/adapter.py's job, not this module's).

Word cap: LIVE_CUE_MAX_WORDS (config.py), counted with the SAME len(text.split()) aggregate.py's
existing Stage-0 coaching-cue assertion already uses -- one definition of "word count", not two.
An over-cap cue is FLAGGED (CueResult.over_word_cap), never silently truncated -- this is what
caught squat.json's shallow_depth and pushup.json's shallow_pushup cues both being over the
8-word cap (a copy bug, not something to hide by cutting words); both have since been shortened
in the exercise library. See prototype_api/README.md's "Coaching cue layer" section.
