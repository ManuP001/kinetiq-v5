evals/gate0/prototype_api/schemas.py

The request/response envelope for POST /prototype/assess. `frames` is typed loosely (a list of
plain dicts) deliberately -- the Stage-0 keypoint-frame schema is validate_frame_schema's job
(golden_loader.py, EVAL_HARNESS_STAGE0_SPEC.md §5), not a second, independently-maintained
pydantic schema that could drift from it (CLAUDE.md §3: config/schema is a single source of
truth). main.py calls validate_frame_schema on every frame before anything else happens.
