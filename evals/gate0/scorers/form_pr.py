"""
evals/gate0/scorers/form_pr.py

Per-flag precision/recall over the golden set (EVAL_HARNESS_STAGE0_SPEC.md §6), gated against
config.py's severity-split floors -- the pair v1/v2 never measured.

Two edge-case choices, made deliberately here per the spec (not incidental, and not to be
"fixed" later without re-reading §6):
  - A flag carried by a PHANTOM detected rep (no matching ground-truth rep) counts as a false
    positive for that flag. The rep itself never happened, so any fault called on it is also
    fabricated.
  - A fault on a MISSED ground-truth rep (no matching detected rep) counts as a false negative
    for that flag. The detector never got the chance to catch it, but the fault was real.

Severity floors are looked up per-flag and applied per-flag (never one flat bar): high-severity
carries the strictest precision floor but the most lenient recall floor -- precision-first, per
EXERCISE_LIBRARY.md §4.
