# CLAUDE.md — frontend/

Inherits from the root `CLAUDE.md` and the design system in `DESIGN.md`; this states only what's
specific to `frontend/`. This is the live camera PWA — the piece that never existed before v4.

## What it is
A zero-build static PWA (`index.html`, `app.js`, `segments.js`, `styles.css`, `config.js`,
`manifest.json`, `sw.js`).
Served by any static host (`python -m http.server` locally, a Render static site in prod). No
framework, no bundler — one less thing to break at gym wifi speed.

## Data flow (do not break the privacy invariant)
webcam → MediaPipe PoseLandmarker (in-browser) → 33 BlazePose keypoints → a frame
`{t_ms, pose_model:"blazepose_33", people:[{track_id:0, kp:[[x,y,z,vis]×33], box:[x,y,w,h]}]}` → buffered → `POST`ed to
`/prototype/assess`. **Only keypoints leave the browser. Never send the video frame or an image.**

## Conventions
- The frame shape is dictated by the backend's `validate_frame_schema` — if the detector's expected
  keypoint schema changes, change the frame builder in `app.js` to match; do not guess.
- Send only NEW frames each POST with `reset:true` on the first call; the server buffers per session.
- `box` is REQUIRED even with one person: subject-lock picks the subject by box area. MediaPipe gives
  no box, so `bboxOf()` derives one from the visible keypoints. `validate_frame_schema` does not
  check it — omitting it once crashed the detector and reached the browser as "Failed to fetch".
- One visible set may span several server sessions. The server caps a session at
  `session_max_frames` (read from `GET /health`, never hardcoded) — ~2 min at 30fps — and a full
  session answers every request with 413. `segments.js` rolls to a fresh session before that,
  between reps where possible (`SESSION_ROLL_AT` / `SESSION_FORCE_ROLL_AT` in `config.js`), and
  carries the rep count and per-rep records forward. It only sums what the API returns; it never
  decides whether a rep happened.
- `exercise_id` must be one of `squat`/`pushup`/`lunge` (the API rejects others with 422).
- API base URL lives ONLY in `config.js` (`API_BASE_URL`). Deploy = edit that one line / `set-api-url`.
- Flag color comes from `severities.json` (generated from `exercises/*.json`); don't hardcode a
  severity map in JS. Regenerate `severities.json` if a contract's severities change.

## States every screen handles
Loading (model warmup), camera-prompt, permission-denied (+Retry), running, API-unreachable
(non-destructive banner; buffered frames re-queued), empty summary. See `DESIGN.md`.

The re-queue is bounded to one server session's worth of frames (`boundQueue`). Unbounded, a long
outage made every retry a larger body than the last until the server ran out of memory. Anything
shed is disclosed on the summary screen — a count that is quietly low would be dishonest.

## Testing
`node --test frontend/segments.test.mjs` — the roll-over and queue-bounding logic. The PWA's exact
wire shape is pinned server-side by `evals/gate0/prototype_api/test_pwa_frame_contract.py`.

## Boundaries
The PWA is a consumer of the detector, never a second implementation of it. Rep counting, flags, and
cues come from the API response — do not reimplement any detection or thresholding in JavaScript.
